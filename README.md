This program will calculate the GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of two values.
If the user inputs a negative value or 0, it will automatically check if it contains invalid values. 
Then, if the value is valid, it will calculate the GCD by using Euclid's algorithm

This program will recursively calculate the greatest common divisor.
